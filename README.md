- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sishi-Source, I'm 3rd year college student majoring on Computer Engineering
- 👀 I’m interested in open-source softwares, linux, and embedded systems
- 📖 I’m currently learning bare-metal programming and STM32
- ✨ Fun fact: I name my projects imperfect because imperfection always has room for improvement, and I want to improve
